Homes are adjacent to Lake Avalon and very close to the Sugden Regional Park.\n\nThe Next 20 Years: Dramatic and Dramatically Different Growth Go East, Young Entrepreneur Far from slowing in the next 20 years, the Collier County Comprehensive Planning Department projects that the county’s permanent population will nearly double in the next 20 years from 341,726 (Oct. 2006 estimate) to 666,054 by the year 2026. Even that is dwarfed by the seasonal population of 890,000.\n\nWe are going to experience significant growth in the next 20 years,\" said Tom Abraham, Senior Vice President, Construction for Kraft Construction, the largest privately held general building contractor in Florida. \"New shopping centers, schools, and other support facilities are key indicators of the explosive growth that the county is experiencing. Although there are always cycles of growth, we are going to see things come on very strong.\"\n\nThe major retail players are already betting on the eastern migration, according to County Manager Jim Mudd. \"Major retailers such as Wal-Mart and Lowe’s understand that East Naples is a growing economic force and are establishing a presence there,\" he said. \"The new Collier Regional Medical Center will also serve as a catalyst for growth.\"\n\nIn a 2005 residential build-out study, county planners projected that 1.1 million people will be living in Collier County at build-out—55% of them east of Collier Boulevard. Some analysts have doubted whether that prediction is realistic, but nobody doubts that Southwest Florida will continue to be a phenomenal draw for people, jobs, and opportunity.\n\nAnticipating the need for a much more robust infrastructure, county planners have mapped out major extensions and interchanges for east Collier in a recent transportation study. They envision a new roadway extending from US 41 east of Collier Boulevard to I-75; a parallel roadway along I-75 from the Everglades Boulevard to Collier Boulevard; a fly-over at US 41 and Collier Boulevard; and extensions of Green Boulevard and Vanderbilt Beach Road all the way to Desoto Boulevard in the Estates.\n\nThe real explosion will be even farther to the East. County planners say that the unparalleled growth potential of the Immokalee urban area that currently comprises undeveloped or agricultural land, looks very much like the coastal urban area in 1970—when Collier County had only 38,040 residents.\n\nLand experts agree. Mike Timmerman, Florida Managing Director for Hanley Wood Market Intelligence and founder Feasinomics Inc., has monitored the market change related to residential and related commercial real estate for more than 20 years. \"Eastern Collier County is where the action will be in the next two decades,\" he said. \"In 20 years, Immokalee will become its own thriving community and will move from a predominantly agricultural to a more diversified economy.\"\n\n\"We will see tremendous growth on U.S. 41 east of Collier Boulevard,\" he added. \"The growth that will occur in that area affords an opportunity to create some unique destination projects.\"\n\n\"Ten years ago, North Naples looked much like East and South Naples do today. Expansion and widening of Immokalee Road brought businesses to that corridor,\" said Todd Kendall of Premier Properties of Southwest Florida. \"Land is no longer available in other parts of Naples , so we are going to see the majority of growth taking place in East Naples.\"\n",

The entire community is fenced for added security and lushly landscaped with meticulous attention to detail.\n\nThe Banyan Woods clubhouse is a favorite gathering place and offers a 1,200 SF, state-of-the-art fitness center, plus a party room and card room, and a heated spa. There is also a basketball court and a great playground for the kids.\n\nTennis lovers will be delighted to find that two of Naples’ prestigious tennis clubs are within walking distance of Banyan Woods. And of course, Naples’ myriad golf courses – for every level of play desired – are close by.\n\nThe lifestyle and amenities found in Banyan Woods is rare – and becoming even more so. It’s a true treasure chest of fine homes, nestled in the center of a vibrant area of Naples at the crux of Airport and Pine Ridge Roads. Everything is within your reach from here: fine shopping and dining, scintillating Gulf of Mexico beaches, exciting fishing and boating opportunities and fascinating cultural and historic attractions - all the best that Naples has to offer.

Some call Bonita Shores the perfect location – right near the main thoroughfares that open the way to Fort Myers, Bonita Springs proper and Naples, the region’s gems – yet far enough away to be considered an peaceful retreat. Others just call it home.\n\nQuite literally on the shores of Little Hickory Bay and several lesser bays and waterways, Bonita Shores started out as a community for retirees many years ago. Today the area attracts a variety of full-time residents including many young families. The Gulf of Mexico beaches are so close it is little wonder why this area is so coveted. In fact, in the past few years there has been a very low residential turnover.

Numerous waterways provide opportunities to enjoy boating and fishing. Nature preserves dot the area and are perfect for hiking and bird watching; and of course, there is the climate itself, which lends perfectly to the active outdoor lifestyle\n\n\n\nThe Bonita Shores Club\n\nIn 1953, Forrest Walker developed Little Hickory and Bonita Shores, which is a north Collier County subdivision, just off Bonita Beach Road, and encompasses from 1st Street to 9th Street and from Vanderbilt Drive to Hickory Bay.\n\nBack then, it was considered out in the wilderness, and far away from the then-county seat, Everglades City. Bonita Shores also did not consider itself part of the original Bonita Springs, which was located four miles northeast of the community. What is now Vanderbilt Drive was known as East Avenue, and ended at 9th Street in Bonita Shores. To reach the Shores subdivision, one traveled Old US 41 or sometimes called Tamiami Trail, turned west on Bonita Beach Road at the dog track, and drove the four miles to our location. Bonita Beach Road continued west to the Gulf, then north to the northern end of Hickory Island. The causeway to Ft Myers Beach was not built until the mid-1960's. Because of its remote location at the time, residents formed the association to make sure deed restrictions and other niceties remained enforced.\n\nThe club, officially named Bonita Shores & Little Hickory Shores Improvement Association, Inc., started in 1956, three years after construction began in the community. It incorporated as a non-profit in April 1960. The property that the Bonita Shores Club sits on was deeded to the association and the clubhouse construction was completed in same year, just in time for Hurricane Donna.\n\nWhat is today a storage garage was a fire station back in 1967 with one fire truck. Fire control and the property the garage sits on today was given to the fire district that same year. The \"fire house\" was returned to the association by the fire district in 1992.\n\nThe clubhouse began as a single room structure. An addition was added to the west side of the building in 1980. In October of 1982, a large 24' x 24' addition was added to the north side of the building, completing the clubhouse as we know it today. In 1983, the three rooms were named Collier, Hickory and Bonita.\n\nIn the last fifty years, the Bonita Shores Club has hosted many happy gatherings: Easter egg hunts, wedding receptions, anniversary parties, community pot-luck dinners, art fairs, yard sales, exercise classes, tax seminars, bridge games, and of course, the traditional Monday night bingo games. It continues to be a hub of community involvement, and source of pride for our community.\n\nIn the early days of the association, focus centered on community improvement, such as paving the neighborhood's roads, water and sewer improvements, and creating what we treasure today as a rare jewel of a community and neighborhood.\n\nAs Bonita Shores approaches the half-century mark, life in the neighborhood has changed, but the vibrant community spirit remains. The shuffle board courts are no longer used much anymore, but line dancing and yoga classes have taken root. School-aged kids ride bikes on the streets along with retired folks. Over the years, Bonita Shores has been transformed from a sleepy retirement community to one of the best non-gated residential communities in the Bonita Springs area. The infusion of younger families who get involved in our community assures that the Bonita Shores Club will see a 100th birthday one day.\n",

Those who set down the blue pints for the Connors Vanderbilt neighborhood of North Naples gave much credence to the well-known axiom for success: Begin with the end in mind.\n\nClearly the objective here was to create an inviting, single-family home community, surrounded by nature, that would be an ideal place for active families and those seeking peaceful waterfront living. It is no surprise then, that Connors Vanderbilt is one of the most prestigious, coveted and simply perfect residential neighborhoods in all of Naples.\n\nStarting in the north at the ecologically diverse and picturesque Delnor Wiggins State Park and continuing down the coast as far south as the world-renown Ritz-Carlton Hotel on Vanderbilt Drive, this area teems with the grace of nature’s gem, the Southwest Gulf Coast of Florida. Residents delight regularly to the soaring seabirds that frequent the skies and shorelines. It is not unusual to see magnificent manatees, sizeable yet serene sea turtles, dancing dolphins and mesmerizing reptiles all in one day.\n\nHomes here are mostly waterfront, some directly on the beach, which enjoy unobstructed, glowing sunsets that stretch out into the Gulf of Mexico each evening. Other residences are set on the cool bay or on deep, navigable canals and boast private boat docks right outside their back door and a clear, water passage to the plentiful fishing spots of Naples Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. A limited number of streets, most culminating in quiet cul-de-sacs, offer a select amount of private residential lots of varying sizes.\n\nIn this active North Naples real estate market, single-family homes range in price according to size, lot, construction and location. Call us today to tour available 2 and 3 bedroom homes or 4 or 5 bedroom homes. Whatever your needs dictate, you’ll find here in Vanderbilt Beach.\n",

The area was developed with a sharp eye on environmental responsibility.\n\nMore than half the total land area of The Brooks will remain open, protected space.\n\nFour gated communities make up the development and pivot around The Town Center. Each distinct section offers a particular lifestyle with various living options.\n\nShadow Wood is traditional country club living, Spring Run and Copperleaf are golf course communities, and Lighthouse Bay is loved for its waterfront views. A range of home styles is available from custom estates and single-family homes to carriage and coach homes, villas and condominiums.\n\nThe Town Center itself, complete with village green and gazebo, is somewhat revolutionary in conception. A community with soul?\n\nThis focal point of The Brooks provides opportunities for residents to gather, interact, know and enjoy their neighbors. Through membership in The Commons Club, residents may frequent the Enrichment Center for hands-on learning, the full service Fitness Center with workout rooms, classes and spa facilities, the private, casual dining restaurant Rosie Spoonbill’s, and the private Beach Club that is just short drive away on the gulf at Bonita Beach.\n\nGolf is amazing at The Brooks, as would be expected. Four championship courses are available for challenging rounds. The Shadow Wood Country Club is home to the North and South course, designed by Bob Cupp and featuring a striking 30,000±SF country club with every amenity. Shadow Wood’s third course is located 5 miles north in the Shadow Wood Preserve, an idyllic natural setting. Gordon Lewis designed the course at Spring Run which boasts an aquatic driving range. Lewis also designed the Copperleaf course who’s clubhouse includes a swimming pool and spa.\n\nResidents have full access to tennis courts, pools, open spaces and miles of walking and biking trails that meander through each neighborhood.\n\nMuch old-time charm and consideration went into planning The Brooks, but modern conveniences were certainly not overlooked. The Brooks is wired throughout for high-speed, fiber optic data and voice services. There is also a community focused intranet, where residents can access local information, make tee-times or tennis reservations, post messages and link up with other residents.\n\nOn the outside, old-fashioned and community-oriented, just below the surface an innovative residential ideal, The Brooks may just be the master planned community of the future.\n",

	"title":"Everglades City Florida",
	"order":1,
	"content":"\"Everglades City” is known as the Gateway to the 10,000 Islands, and for paddlers that is most certainly true. It is one end of the Wilderness Waterway, the famous Everglades backcountry route linking Everglades City to Flamingo. It is one of the best places in the 10,000 Islands to rent canoes or kayaks, meet up with a guided paddling excursion, or find a comfortable room from which to base your explorations within the Big Cypress National Preserve, Everglades National Park, and Fakahatchee Strand State Preserve. Everglades City even has a small airport, so you can fly in and book a float plane tour to get a bird's-eye view of the 10,000 islands before putting your paddle to the water.\n\nPrior to 1923, Everglades City was called Everglade, a name given the settlement along the crooked little Allen's River in 1893 by Bembery Storter after the U.S. Post Office refused the request for the name Chokoloskee. Farming was the primary occupation of people living in the area and included sugarcane, bananas, and vegetables. Fishing was actually secondary until around 1923 Allen gave Everglades City its start, but George T. Storter is considered the true founder of the town. He and his family were prominent in Everglade's growth and activities and owned much of the land around the town until the arrival of Baron Collier in 1923. It was under the Storter stewardship the Everglade began to draw visitors and sportsmen. The Rod and Gun Club was built around the Storter home.\n\nBarron Collier is primarily responsible for the foundation of Everglades City as you see it today. In 1923 he and his company purchased most of the land in and surrounding the town. Within five years the sleepy trading post and farming community was converted into a bustling industrial-based company town complete with roads, railroad, bank, telephone, sawmills, boatyard, churches, school, workers' barracks and mess halls, and even its own streetcar at one point in time. The Ivey House, home of NACT-Everglades Rentals and Eco Adventures, was once one of the Collier Company workers' barracks.\n\nWith the establishment of Everglades National Park and subsequent purchase of most of Big Cypress Swamp and the 10,000 Islands for conservation, Everglades City once again looks to the natural environment for economic viability through nature tourism, sport fishing, and commercial crabbing. Everglades National Park was formally dedicated in Everglades City on December 6, 1947. The Gulf Coast Visitor Center of Everglades National Park is perched at the edge of the Chokoloskee Bay, and many paddling routes depart from the canoe ramp behind the maintenance buildings.\"\n\nFor more information on any property in the community just give us a call at 239-261-9050 or email us at info@NoSnowNaples.com\n\n\nEVERGLADES CITY ACTIVITIES\n\n\n\nEverglades Area Tours Enjoy a guided boat tour in the 10,000 Islands; Experience kayak fishing in the Everglades National Park backcountry; Canoe through magnificent mangrove tunnels; Enjoy a guided bicycle tour amongst old-growth cypress hammocks; Catch tarpon and snook on a guided fishing trip; Hike into the prairies, wetlands and sloughs to find rare orchids; Take a guided birding trip; or over fly the entire area in a float plane.\n\nLocated in Everglades City, ½hour from Naples & Marco Island; Less than 1 ½ hours from Miami, Ft.

Largest subdivision? Now, don’t go imagining salt-box houses crammed onto streets crowded with residents trying to get in an out. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nIn truth, Livingston Woods, and its sister neighborhood, Logan Woods is made up of spacious, wooded home-sites. The majority of lots are over 1 acre, with most being much larger than that – think 5 acres, and on up to 10! Imagine a huge parcel of your own land – with few restrictions – on which you can build your dream lifestyle. A large home, perhaps a guest house, some stables for your horses, of course a swimming pool and ... a tennis or basketball court? How about a sprawling garden or an open field of grass for a game of touch football or a soccer practice area...sound good? It’s here.\n\nThat’s how people live here in Livingston Woods – exactly how they want; with lots of space, privacy and naturally wooded beauty thrown in. It’s a country lifestyle, that still close to town. Downtown Naples is just 18 miles away, as are the sandy Gulf beaches. Naples is the golf capital of Florida, and there’s a course close by to suit any level of play, if you like. You can also hike in one of the several natural preserves in this area or head down to the Everglades for unrivaled wildlife watching.\n\nGolden Gate Estates is well-known, popular, and growing. Property values are at an all time high. We’d love to show you what properties are still available – there are some open lots still on the market. There really are no other neighborhoods to compare with either Livingston Wood or Logan Woods. Residents know it – and if you talk to any of them, they’ll tell you that they live in heaven on earth. They live on their own land, on their own terms. Where else can you find something like that, so close to all the necessary conveniences of modern life? Don’t miss your chance for a piece of heaven!\n\nFor more information on any property in the community just give us a call at 239-261-9050 or email us at info@NoSnowNaples.com\n",

It depends on what you as a homeowner want and need. So communities that are planned and gated don’t always give you the flexibility you may be craving. Welcome to Logan Woods. Situated within the larger, coveted community of Golden Gate Estates, Logan Woods offers multiple benefits, including many things that other Naples area neighborhoods may not – flexibility and space.\n\nLogan Woods, and its sister neighborhoods, Livingston Woods and Oakes Estates, offer large, wooded lots. The residents here went so far as to change the street designations from numbers to names. Why? Because Logan Woods is a family-oriented, laid-back, quiet area filled with life-loving homeowners. Numbers just didn’t seem to fit. Names give a descriptive identity to the area a warmer feel to make it seem like you’re coming home to a classic neighborhood, where you know your neighbor and they know you, and even if you never do more than wave hello, you feel welcome here.\n\nThe lots here range from 150 ft to over 650 ft deep. That’s plenty of room for the house of your dreams, a guest cottage, horse barns or maybe a tennis court and pool. As you can imagine, there is plenty of privacy. The entire area is wooded with an abundance of plantings and natural flora and tall trees. It’s lush and breezes bring the smell of pine and the calming rustle of wind through the trees. The real beauty of the place is that it doesn’t matter what sort of lifestyle suits your fancy – you can have it all here in a naturally exquisite setting! Best of all, property values are at an all time high in Golden Gate Estates – the largest subdivision in the country, with over 100 square miles of land. Now’s the time to come and find your idea of the good life – on acreage!\n\nGolden Gate Estates is called “the other Naples” because it offers this country style of living unique to most of Southwest Florida. But the bonus of living here is that you’re literally 20 minutes from Naples and all that the vibrant town has to offer, including the beautiful Gulf beaches. In 30 minutes, you can be at the international airport and in less than 5 minutes, you can be headed north or south on Interstate 75.\n\nTo call Golden Gate Estates and the neighborhood of Logan Woods “ideal” only partly describes it as a place to live. It is near perfect given that you can choose your lifestyle, have total privacy – yet still have the feel of a true neighborhood, and adapt your plot of land to your wants and needs. It wouldn’t be remiss to say you can have it all in Logan Woods, but it would be terrible to miss an opportunity to make an investment in a home here. As with all good things, it won’t last forever. Golden Gate Estates is popular and growing – why not call us now so we can show you some of the prime properties that are currently available?\n\nFor more information on any property in the community just give us a call at 239-261-9050 or email us at info@NoSnowNaples.com\n",

Finding available properties for sale here is a treasure hunt – there are some opportunities, but they tend to go by fast! Why do so many people want to live in The Moorings?\n\nFor one thing, it’s a true beach front neighborhood with many homes directly on the Gulf or on a bay, lake or inlet, and the rest within walking or biking distance to the beach. The property owners association of The Moorings owns Lowdermilk Park and residents enjoy access to a private beach. Because most homes are on the water, boating enthusiasts can keep their launches at their own private dock or close by. Access to the Gulf is easy, even with a few bridges.\n\nThe neighborhood itself is made up of single-family homes, estate properties and condominiums – something for everyone. Most homes have pools and spas and older homes have been updated from their original 50’s and 60’s designs to modern standards. Even if you’re not right on the water, you’ve got a spectacular view of it, not to mention front-row seating for the famous dramatic, nightly sunsets. Gently curving streets and avenues are shaded by tall trees and offer great walking, jogging, biking and skating opportunities. These canopy plantings; coupled with impeccably landscaped and meticulously manicured properties, create a cool, lush sense of serenity stretching from the main entrance to the sandy shore.\n\nSurrounding this prestigious and beautiful community is The Moorings Country Club. Residents can partake in friendly play year-round on this private, 18-hole, par 3 golf course. Homes around the country club enjoy great golf course views.\n\nOne of the best things about The Moorings, aside from the obviously unmatched Gulf front position, is its location with Naples.

The Moorings is close to downtown including the exciting shopping, dining and nightlife of 3rd Street and 5th Avenue. Its also convenient to major thoroughfares, the international airport and all points north and east.\n\nNo need to ask why people want to live in The Moorings ... the reasons are obvious.

	"content":"Created with all the color, texture and drama of classic Mediterranean style, Mediterra is a master-planned community that evokes the grace, charm and intimacy, that, until now, was never successfully imported from that region of Europe.\n\nThe feeling of Mediterra is conveyed in the tranquility of a deep turquoise sea. In a pathway whose only destination is the imagination.\n\nAnd the lifelong connections made while playing the game of golf. It is unlike any other luxury residential community that ever was, or will be.\n\nLess than 950 residences will be available to ensure the intimacy of low-density neighborhoods on 1,697 private acres...more than half is reserved for open spaces and appreciating nature.\n\nNaturally, no community conceived on this extraordinary scale could fulfill its promise without championship golf. Two, beautiful, Tom Fazio-designed courses await under azure skies. In addition, many other cultural and recreational activities are as much a part of the essence of Mediterra as marble fountains and excellent wine. It is where the old world melds with your world. Life in Mediterra is an active celebration of nature, golf, surf, tennis, fitness, social activities and lifelong learning.\n\nThe centerpiece of it all is The Piazza. It includes the 25,000-square-foot country club, with formal and casual dining, plus the Sports Club, and a lakeside amphitheater.The Piazza is nestled among grand pastoral gardens and fountains that provide a spectacular ambiance for gatherings of all types. The Mediterra Beach Club is located on a 1.3 acre site on Bonita Beach and is available exclusively to members of The Club at Mediterra.",

Like talking about the game with like-minded folks? Searching for the sort of lifestyle that comes with living close to everything you need and desire, yet nestled away in a peaceful setting? The Naples Bath and Tennis Club may be just what you’re looking for.\n\nLess than 3 miles from the Gulf of Mexico, this private gated community rests on 160 acres. Sparkling waterways flow from lakes past 100 single family homes and 400 one, two and three bedrooms condominium homes.\n\nNaples Bath and Tennis is a unique, gated world-class tennis community comprised of condominium and exquisite single-family residences range in size from approximately 700 to over 6000 square feet of living area. Most residences were built between 1975 and 1992 and offer 2 to 5 bedroom floor plans overlooking 160 acres of mature landscape, preserve and lake views.\n\nThe Naples Bath and Tennis Club is located on 20 acres of natural lakes nestled amongst lush landscaping. The Academia Sanchez-Casal Florida at the Naples Tennis Club features 37 championship clay courts and 1 hard court with fitness center, physical and psychological conditioning, boarding facilities and high school curriculum. Adult tennis programs are personalized and tailored to your specific needs.\n\nAmenities include a heated pool and spa, locker rooms with sauna and steam rooms, spa services all within the 33,000 square foot clubhouse. Located on Airport Pulling Road in Naples, Naples Bath & Tennis is conveniently located near Pine Ridge Middle School, Barron Collier High School, and many local area shopping and dining establishments. Nearby communities include Quail Run Golf Club, Kensington Golf & Country Club, and Hawksridge.\n\nThe Naples Bath and Tennis Club is without a doubt one of the finest tennis facilities in the nation, but it is also one of the most beautiful and coveted residential communities in Southwest Florida. Homes for sale go fast, and the reasons why are clear. The club’s excellent location – close to the beach and to downtown Naples – plus its amenities and facilities make it a one-of-a-kind place to call home.\n\nThe Sanchez Tennis Academy:\n\nAcademia Sánchez-Casal in Barcelona, Spain is renowned as the training ground for such stellar touring pros as Andy Murray, Svetlana Kuznetsova, Anna Ivanovic, Janko Tipsarevic, and others. It has now once again established a training facility in the U.S., after purchasing the former Naples Bath & Tennis Club in Naples, Florida. The academy had been here before, in 2007-2010, but as a tenant rather than an owner. Now former Top 10 singles player and No. 1 doubles player Emilio Sánchez himself has taken up full-time residence in Naples to manage the program. Most of the focus is on junior development—and Sanchez himself takes the courts to personally contribute his expertise.\n\nThere are some 20 enrolled junior full-time (some living at the academy, others locally), a situation made possible by the addition of a school on site. In addition there are afterschool programs (also available to the children of guests there for short stays) and summer and holiday junior camps. Adults do, however, also have their own program under Daniel Sorribas, an Argentinian who had previously run the programs for high-performance coaches and for adults at the Academia in Barcelona. So far, according to Sánchez, the numbers have been small: 4 to 6 a week, he told me, while also characterizing them as \"very high standard\", meaning highly committed players and tournament competitors. A quick glance at the curriculum suggests why: many of the options include not only the usual on-court drills but off-court fitness training as well. Student:pro ratios are kept low: never more than 4:1 and often less.\n\nFor more information on any property in the community just give us a call at 239-261-9050 or email us at info@NoSnowNaples.com\n",

First developed in the 1950’s, the community set on the east side of Vanderbilt Lagoon, was thoughtfully laid out and boasts one of the few grid street systems in the region. Because of this, Naples Park enjoys un-congested mobility. Entering and leaving as well as getting around within the neighborhood is easy.\n\nIn the early days, this location was thought to be somewhat “out of the way” – however, given the recent growth spurt experienced in the immediate area, Naples Park now finds itself in a supreme location! Close by are shops and dining, schools and transportation. Additionally, the powdery white sand beaches of the Gulf of Mexico are within walking distance.\n\nThis single-family community is currently on the upside of growth. Many homes are upgraded and property values are on the rise. As Collier County has increasingly become more culturally rich and diverse, Naples Park has followed suit. A new generation of the upwardly mobile are now moving in and taking full advantage of the great location and all that the greater Naples area has to offer. This area is widely considered to be one of the last ground-floor investment opportunities in the area. Naples Park represents an opportunity to live on one of the most beautiful parcels Southwest Florida’s Gulf Coast has to offer for an average home price depending on size, lot and location.

It depends on what you as a homeowner want and need. So communities that are planned and gated don’t always give you the flexibility you may be craving. Welcome to Oakes Estates. Situated within the larger, coveted community of Golden Gate Estates, Oakes Estates offers multiple benefits, including many things that other Naples area neighborhoods may not – flexibility and space. Oakes Estates and it's sister neighborhoods Logan Woods,and Livingston Woods, offer large, wooded lots. The residents here went so far as to change the street designations from numbers to names. Why? Because Oakes Estates is a family-oriented, laid-back, quiet area filled with life-loving homeowners. Numbers just didn’t seem to fit. Names give a descriptive identity to the area a warmer feel to make it seem like you’re coming home to a classic neighborhood, where you know your neighbor and they know you, and even if you never do more than wave hello, you feel welcome here.\n\nThe lots here range from 150 - 330 ft wide to over 650 ft deep. That’s plenty of room for the house of your dreams, a guest cottage, horse barns or maybe a tennis court and pool. As you can imagine, there is plenty of privacy. The entire area is wooded with an abundance of plantings and natural flora and tall trees. It’s lush and breezes bring the smell of pine and the calming rustle of wind through the trees. The real beauty of the place is that it doesn’t matter what sort of lifestyle suits your fancy – you can have it all here in a naturally exquisite setting! Best of all, property values are at an all time high in Golden Gate Estates – the largest subdivision in the country, with over 170 square miles of land. Now’s the time to come and find your idea of the good life – on acreage!\n\nOakes Estates is called “the other Naples” because it offers this country style of living unique to most of Southwest Florida. But the bonus of living here is that you’re literally 20 minutes from Naples and all that the vibrant town has to offer, including the beautiful Gulf beaches. In 30 minutes, you can be at the international airport and in less than 5 minutes, you can be headed north or south on Interstate 75.\n\nTo call Golden Gate Estates and the neighborhood of Oakes Estates “ideal” only partly describes it as a place to live. It is near perfect given that you can choose your lifestyle, have total privacy – yet still have the feel of a true neighborhood, and adapt your plot of land to your wants and needs. It wouldn’t be remiss to say you can have it all in Oakes Estates, but it would be terrible to miss an opportunity to make an investment in a home here. As with all good things, it won’t last forever. Oakes Estates is popular and growing – why not call us now so we can show you some of the prime properties that are currently available?\n\nFor more information on any property in the community just give us a call at 239-261-9050 or email us at info@NoSnowNaples.com\n",

For the Calusa, this area of Florida’s Southwest Coast meant abundance and good living. Throughout the history of Olde Naples, people have continued to come here for essentially the same reasons.\n\nFounded in 1886, Olde Naples is a slice of living history. The original town was centered around the now famous Naples Pier which was built in 1888, and subsequently re-built several times due to various natural disasters. Through its incarnations, the Pier has always drawn and continues to attract those fond of good fishing and stunning Gulf of Mexico sunsets.\n\nThe original settlers recognized the innate values of this area and set about taking full advantage of it and inviting others to do the same.\n\nMillionaires Row was the first line of beachfront homes built back around the turn-of-the-century. This area is the true Olde Naples, however the city has grown beyond this to encompass the region from Mooring Line Drive, south past the Pier and eastward to Naples Bay. Preserving history is a penultimate goal, yet the conveniences of modern life are here as well.\n\nPoints of interest abound including historical sites such as the Pier itself and numerous early buildings and founding homes that have been preserved and are now open to tourists and locals with an interest in origins. Fish, boat, swim, golf, walk, run, bike, think – whatever your pleasure, Olde Naples provides an accommodating venue which includes the fabulous 5th Avenue and 3rd Street South shopping and dining district.\n\nFor more information on any property in the community just give us a call at 239-261-9050 or email us at info@NoSnowNaples.com\n\n\nSubdivisions / Condos\n\n400 BUILDING, 555 ON FIFTH, 689 NINTH ST NORTH, 780 FIFTH AVENUE SOUTH, 800 CENTRAL CLUB, ADMIRAL APTS, ALCOSA APTS, AQUARIUS, ARBORESQUE, ARBORS AT OLDE NAPLES, ARCHWAY VILLAS, ASHLEY COURT, AVON MANOR, BARCLAY, BAY TERRACE, BAYPORT VILLAGE, BAYSIDE VILLAS, BAYVIEW, BEACH BREEZE, BEACHCOMBER CLUB, BEACHWALK, BEACHWALK APTS, BEACHWALK BY THE SEA, BELLASERA, BENCHMARK, BLUE MARLIN, BORAN-MARTIN BUILDING, BOUGAINVILLEA GARDENS, BROADVIEW VILLAS, BUTTONWOOD AT OLDE NAPLES, CAMBIER COURT, CAMBIER PLACE, CAMBRIDGE CLUB, CARDINAL COURT, CASA BELLA, CASTLETON GARDENS, CENTRAL GARDEN, CHARTER CLUB OF OLDE NAPLES, CHATELAIN APTS, COCONUT GROVE, COLONIAL MANOR, COLONNADE CLUB, COMMUNITY MEDICAL BLDG, CORAL CLUB, COURTYARD AT OLDE NAPLES, COVE INN, COVE VILLAS, DEVON COURT, DEVONSHIRE CLUB, DOCTORS PROFESSIONAL BUILDING, DORSET CLUB, DOWNS TOWN, DRIFTWOOD OF OLDE NAPLES, ESSEX HOUSE, FIFTH AT PARK PLAZA, FLAMINGO HIDEAWAY, FLORESTA BUILDING, FRANCISCAN, FRANCISCAN GARDENS, FRANKLIN ARMS, FRENCH QUARTER, GARDEN COTTAGES OF OLD NAPLES, GARDEN COURT, GARDEN MANOR, GARDEN TERRACE, GLOUCESTER BAY, GOLF DRIVE ESTATES, GULF BREEZE OF OLDE NAPLES, GULF EAST, GULF SOUTH, GULFVIEW HEIGHTS, GULFWALK, HALEKULANI, HAMILTON CLUB, HEMINGWAY PLACE, HOLLY LEE, ISLA MAR, KASOTA BAY, KASOTA QUARTERS, KASOTA SOUTH, KASOTA THIRD, KENSINGTON GARDENS, LA GALLERIA, LA MAJORCA, LAKERIDGE VILLAS, LAKEVIEW MEDICAL PLAZA, LAKEVIEW OF OLDE NAPLES, LAKEVIEW TERRACE, LANDING, LANTANA, LANTERNS, LARGO, LAS DUNAS, LUCAYA CAY, MANOR APTS, MARA VILLA, MARINA MANOR, MARINA VILLAS, MARINER, MUNICIPAL PLAZA, NAPLES COMMERCIAL PLAZA, NAPLES LARCHMONT, NAPLES MARINA VILLAS, NEAPOLITAN CLUB, NORTH PORT COVE, OLD COVE, OLDE BAY VIEW BLDG OF NAPLES, OLDE NAPLES, OLDE NAPLES VILLAS, OLDE TOWNE CONDO, OLDE TOWNE PLACE, OLDE WESTLAKE VILLAS, ORCHID PLACE, OXFORD COURT, PALM COURT, PAR LA VILLE, PARK TERRACE, PARK VIEW COURT, PARKSIDE, PARKSIDE OFF 5TH, PARKVIEW COURT, PARKVIEW OF NAPLES, PELICAN APTS, PERGOLA VILLAS, PERIWINKLE, PETTIT SQUARE, PIER 8, PIERRE CLUB, PLANTATION, POINCIANA HEIGHTS, POWELL AND YANSON BLDG, POWERBOAT SQUADRON MARINA, RAINTREE CLUB, RESIDENCES OF OLD NAPLES, RIDGE LAKE, RIDGEVIEW LAKES, ROSE VILLAS, ROYAL COVE, ROYAL PALM VILLAS, RUSTLING PALMS, RUSTY PELICAN, SANDDRIFT, SANDPIPER COVE, SANDRIFT, SANDY CAY, SANDY LANE, SEA CREST, SEA WALK, SEAPORT, SEAWALK, SHADOWMOSS, SHERWOOD GARDENS, SOMERDALE, SOUTH BEACH CLUB, SOUTHWINDS APTS OF NAPLES, SPELLBINDER VILLAS, SPRING LAKE, ST CHARLES, ST JAMES, STONES THROW, SUN COAST, SUN DIAL OF NAPLES, SUNCOAST APTS, SUNTIDE ON TENTH, TERRACES OF OLDE NAPLES, THE COLONNADE ON 5TH, TIFFANY COURT, TOWN BEACH CLUB, TOWN MANOR, TWIN PALMS, UPTOWN VILLAS, VICTOR DEL REY, VILLA AVELLINO, VILLA DANNA, VILLA DEL TORRES, VILLA FIRENZE, VILLA VERONA AT OLD NAPLES, VILLA VERSAILLES, VILLA YVONNE, VILLAS AVENIDA, VILLAS CALABRIA, VILLAS CALLABRIA, VILLAS DEL MAR, VILLAS DI MARINO, VILLAS ESCALANTE, VILLAS RACHAEL, VILLAS RAVELLO, VILLAS SIENNA, VILLAS TORINO, WARICK, WARRENTON, WARWICK, WEATHERWOOD, WHITE SANDS",

	"content":"A grand plan for community living that includes all the amenities of modern life, yet harkens back to olde-time neighborhood lifestyle, coupled with a location that is at once both one of the most rapidly growing areas of the country and one of the most naturally beautiful places in the world, has given rise to Palmira Golf & Country Club.\n\nThis 21st century community is ideally set on Bonita Beach Road just a few miles west of Interstate 75 in Bonita Springs. At Palmira, multiple residential enclaves offer custom homes in every style and size. And while each neighborhood offers its own level of community, the whole of Palmira is centered around the gorgeous Renaissance Club, The Village, the Tennis Center and of course, the Golf Club.\n\nSurrounding the community with contoured fairways, challenging greens, meandering lakes crowned by bridges and natural hazards rimmed by boardwalks, are Palmira's three complimentary and challenging, 18-hole golf courses: The Ibis, The Osprey and the Egret. The latter recently enhanced by nine new Gordon Lewis-designed holes.\n\nFinishing up a round of golf at Palmira is almost as desirable as teeing off and you'll agree, once you see the casually elegant 2-story, 30,000 square foot Clubhouse. Golfers, residents and guests enjoy gourmet dining at the Clubhouse in both formal and relaxed atmospheres. Retire with a brandy to the fireside lounge or continue playing in the card and billiards room. Pick up some accoutrements at the fully stocked pro-shop or visit the spa for body-soothing treatments after a long day on the links or just a day set aside for a bit of pampering.\n\nIs tennis your game? Well, then get ready for game, set and match! Palmira just expanded the Tennis Center to include 7 well-maintained, lighted, clay courts, a pro shop, men's and women's locker rooms, saunas and select spa treatments.\n\nThe Renaissance Center Club and The Village are at the hub of community life. The unique Renaissance Center offers all the amenities and services you'd expect from a first-class, resort-style club. At the Center, you'll find innumerable ways to activate and rejuvenate your body, mind and soul. Features include a state-of-the-art fitness center with personal trainers and a professional staff, massage and spa services, activity center offering instruction in everything from pottery to computers, and a media center where members can attend lectures or lease the space for their own presentations.\n\nThe Village is a fresh-air park, perfect for strolling in an unhurried manner, grabbing something to eat at the snack bar or cafe, catch a movie, play or concert at the outdoor theater, and give the kids a chance to safely romp in children's play area with its interactive fountain.\n\nOf course, there is also a 2,800 square foot heated lagoon-style pool, a whirlpool spa and a lap pool. Truly, the Renaissance Center is where its at something for everyone and plenty of space for all.\n\nThe planners of the Palmira Golf & Country Club, envisioned all these activity centers and gathering spaces for two reasons: the first to give residents the unmatched ability to engage in the activities that interested them, and the second to allow them to enjoy these activities and amenities right at their own doorstep.\n\nBut the planners didn't stop there, they have also put extensive time and thought into the neighborhoods at Palmira as well. Each neighborhood is unique, yet each offers the ultimate in lifestyle.\n\nThe neighborhoods at Palmira Golf & Country Club are:\n\nSiena,\nAvieto & Ravista\nBellezza\nAvallone\nVilla Tuscany\nVilla d'Este & Bella Vita\nLa Tremiti\nCaravella\nNovela\nThe Enclave\nPaloma\nYou can find out more about the Palmira Golf & Country Club by contacting our team of real estate professionals.

Although each neighborhood is nestled within its own corner of Pelican Landing, some edging an estuary or creek, some at the periphery of a preserve, and some flanking a rolling golf course fairway, all offer harmony and endless ways of actively enjoying life.\n\nCertainly there is golf – on some of the finest courses around.

The result is an ecologically sound environment with phenomenal play that even the Professionals find challenging. Each course has a set of seven tees ranging from 4600 yards to 7100 yards that offer every level of player an equal opportunity to enjoy their long and short game, and improve their skills. Eighteen-hole rounds are made of two nine-hole courses, which rotate on a daily basis.

Known the world over, it is considered one of the most prestigious and exclusive neighborhoods in existence. High standards of building and a population of just over 550 families have kept Port Royal the pristine and coveted community it has been for over 40 years.\n\nConsidered by some as a play land for the privileged, Port Royal has the good fortune of being located on the exquisite Floridian west coast. The stunning natural beauty found at the union of land and sea surrounds the area.\n\nOriginally settled as a winter retreat for wealthy northerners back in the 1950’s and 1960’s, the area has advanced greatly since then as a year-round community. Much of the early, small-scale construction – homes of only 2,000 to 3,000 square feet - has been replaced with grander, luxury residences ranging in size from around 5,000 square feet all the way up to over 10,000.\n\nNavigable channels meander in and around the stately, single-family homes of this resort-like area. Waterways, fabricated with the double intentions of filling in the land for home sites and of creating miles and miles of waterfront properties, form a canvas of inlets and coves. The majority of the estate homes here are set on deep canals suitable for docking almost any size boat or yacht right outside the back door.\n\nPort Royal is perfectly positioned at the southernmost end of Naples, just between the gulf and the bay. Residents enjoy easy access to Naples Bay, the Gulf of Mexico, the Ten Thousand Islands, Gordon’s Pass and Keywayden Island. They also benefit from the security of a single entry point into Port Royal, keeping the community very private.\n\nMembership to the distinguished and exclusive Port Royal Club is primarily limited to residents. The club, which is on the scale and par of the world’s finest private clubs, offers a tennis center, formal and informal dining, Olympic-sized heated swimming pool, 425 feet of impeccable beachfront, and all the expected luxury amenities, conveniences and services.\n\nHome prices in distinctive Port Royal vary due to the wide range of available lot sizes and home construction.

	"content":"For information on The Rapallo Community call 239-261-9050 or Info@NoSnownaples.com\n\n2007 DAVID GRAHAM AWARD FOR EXCELLENCE IN DEVELOPMENT\n\nPresented by The Estero Community Planning Panel and the Estero Design Review Committee to recognize a development of distinction and exceptional merit in the Estero community.\n\nPresented to RAPALLO AT COCONUT POINT by Wallace Homes\n\nFrom antiquity to today the Mediterranean coastal towns have embraced a simpler yet fuller life in harmony with Nature and the town itself. This ideal was the inspiration for Rapallo at Coconut Point, a 114 acre, 540 home community which captures the Mediterranean mosaic of serenity and romance and marries it with of the connected Baby Boomer resort-lifestyle.\n\nThe concept for Rapallo was the outgrowth of extensive public domain and proprietary research including a five-year multi-dimensional residential tracking study, a series of consumer focus groups as well as exploratory trips to Liguria (the Italian Riviera) by the Wallace Homes design team.\n\nAttention to detail is everything at Rapallo. The architecture avoids the stereotype of horizontal lines in beige-on-beige monotones and instead creates a unique sense of place. Vertical architectural breaks, random roof lines, a mix of French, Tuscan and Moorish towers, deep shadow lines, contrasting color palettes, plus flagstone, brick, tile and copper accents and hidden off-street garages all bring a real Mediterranean profile to life.\n\nThe hardscaping theme of scalloped walls and repeating column/trellis/bougainvillea creates intimate spaces throughout the community. A substantial collection of public art takes center stage at key viewpoints and the lush, somewhat eclectic landscaping is true to the Ligurian coast, blending form, size, texture and smell in refreshing new ways.\n\nToday’s Baby Boomer wants it all – the nostalgia of childhood neighborhoods, safe havens after 9/11 and all the plugged-in live/work/play conveniences. Rapallo responds to this with pedestrian-scale site planning – a truly “walkable” community with lush sidewalks and biking paths connecting residents to club amenities, shopping, neighbors...and exercise. Although Rapallo is a gated community, five pedestrian gates interconnect to arterial walkways and encourage residents to “leave the car at home”.\n\nBy using less than approved density and by being sensitive to intensity Rapallo creates enough breathing room for seven bridges over 22 acres of lakes, 23 acres of wildlife preserve plus five corner parks and amenity areas to define neighborhoods.\n\nThe member’s only resort-lifestyle Club at Rapallo delivers an incomparable choice of sports, fitness, leisure, learning and social activities. The clubhouse and lagoon pools, the tennis center and stadium court, the fitness center and Olympic lap pool, the arts and learning studio, the botanical garden, the bocce garden, the stocked lakes, the beach shuttle, the wildlife preserve and 2 miles of walking biking path make Rapallo the club with just about everything.\n\nBy listening carefully to the consumer, experimenting with unconventional ideas, taking risks and breaking the mold, Rapallo has redefined the curve. And everyone better for it.\n\nFor more information on the Rapallo community call 239-261-9050 or email info@NoSnowNaples.com",

	"content":"Communities like The Moorings, located west of U.S. 41, are coveted. Finding available properties for sale here is a treasure hunt – there are some opportunities, but they tend to go by fast! Why do so many people want to live in The Moorings?\n\nFor one thing, it’s a true beach front neighborhood with many homes directly on the Gulf or on a bay, lake or inlet, and the rest within walking or biking distance to the beach. The property owners association of The Moorings owns Lowdermilk Park and residents enjoy access to a private beach. Because most homes are on the water, boating enthusiasts can keep their launches at their own private dock or close by. Access to the Gulf is easy, even with a few bridges.\n\nThe neighborhood itself is made up of single-family homes, estate properties and condominiums – something for everyone. Most homes have pools and spas and older homes have been updated from their original 50’s and 60’s designs to modern standards.

Gently curving streets and avenues are shaded by tall trees and offer great walking, jogging, biking and skating opportunities.

Residents can partake in friendly play year-round on this private, 18-hole, par 3 golf course. Homes around the country club enjoy great golf course views.\n\nOne of the best things about The Moorings, aside from the obviously unmatched Gulf front position, is its location with Naples.

Tiburon boasts two championship golf courses – the Black Course and the Gold Course – both designed by Greg Norman. Now, sharks to most infer ferocity, sharp teeth and a predatorial bent toward anything that crosses its path. Perhaps in competition this visual serves Mr. Norman well, but when it comes to the golf courses he designs, like those at Tiburon, he may sooner be likened to a butterfly.\n\nNorman’s design philosophy is one of treading lightly on the land and leaving as much to its natural state as possible. Instead of cutting down a stand of trees, the thought is on how to mold the course around the trees, using them as an anchor or pivot point.\n\nNowhere is this environmentally responsible attitude more evident than on the dual courses of Tiburon – which have in fact been certified as an Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary by Audubon International.\n\nBut do not be fooled. Not only beautiful, the courses offer numerous challenges including coquina sand hazards, numerous water features, an absence of rough areas and some tricky greens. Tiburon is renowned as an “ultimate golfing destination” and is home to the 295 room Ritz-Carlton Golf Resort.\n\nIt also hosts the PGA Sanctioned Franklin Templeton “Shark” Shootout. Built on 800 acres of fertile, lush and enchanting Southwest Florida earth, Tiburon is a community of stately and exquisite residences: sprawling estate homes directly on the golf course, mid-rise residences replete with privacy, full-floor penthouses with panoramic views, villas, executive homes and carriage houses, all set on gently curving streets and Royal Palm-lined avenues. Flowing fountains and ever-blooming flowers add touches of class and sophistication – just a few examples of the numerous and thoughtful details the planners included to set it apart as a special place to live.\n\nThe clubhouse is an exceptional two-story complex with a pro-shop, practice ranges, private concierge service, two dining rooms and a brand new health and fitness center. A Rick Smith Golf Academy is also located here and offers professional instruction for all levels of play.\n\nResidents of Tiburon are delighted to find easy transportation to the sugary sands and aqua waters of the Gulf of Mexico.

Once there, they are offered complimentary towel service, sunscreen, beach chairs, bottle water and lunch from Tiburon’s beach menu.\n\nTiburon offers a lifestyle akin to that of a first-class resort. No amenity has been forgotten, no detail overlooked. Life in Tiburon is an experience of the senses. One feels at ease here, because everything here was created and is maintained with that goal in mind.\n\nThe richly appointed and spacious estate homes sell rapidly in Tiburon, as do the wonderful villas, spacious condominiums and lovely mid-rise residences boasting gorgeous views of water and/or the golf course.

The Vista Club offers casual dining with outstanding views and the enlarged Wyndemere Room offers elegant space for social events, weddings, and gourmet dining. All new locker rooms, pro shop, and administrative offices completed the renovation.\n\nWith 634 homes, Wyndemere is a size that is small enough to get to know members but yet large enough to provide the very finest facilities for members to enjoy.
